# Breadth-First-Search-Algorithm

BFS algorithm implementation in the C programming language.

The algorithm uses an Adjacency Matrix.

The Graph data structure used is undirected and not weighted.

The Graph looks like the following:

                1--------2
                |        |
                |        |
                |        |              
                4--------3
                 \      /
                  \    /
                   \  /
                     5
                   /   \
                  /      \
                 6        7
               
Here 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 are the nodes and the rest are the edges.
